# CAL51-EP300-troubleshoot_Jul-2018
CAL51 EP300 troubleshoot experiment - DMSO, JQ1, THZ531 treated

Motivation: No differential was observed in preliminary H3K27Ac and EP300 ChIP-seq experiments on CAL51 and MDA-MB-231 treated with DMSO, Gefitinib 1uM, THZ531 200nM, Gefitinib 1uM + THZ531 200nM (12h-timepoint for all drug conditions), despite massive DEGs observed in RNA-seq data (same cell lines, same treatment conditions). 

Set-up: Small-scale experiment 
- One cell line: CAL51
- Treatment conditions: DMSO, JQ1 500nM, THZ531 200nM x 12h-timepoint 
  -- JQ1 as positive, given the somewhat known MOA of JQ1 through BRD4 inhibition. Differentials on p300 ChIP-seq has been shown in JQ1-treated AML cell lines. 
  -- Repeat of THZ531 treatment, given the largest number of DEGs observed in THZ531-only (vs DMSO) RNA-seq data. 
- ChIP for EP300 x triplicates: total 9 samples
- Sequence all 9 samples (without input controls) on Illumina MiSeq
